# IDSC Workshops

This repository holds artifacts used in learning workshops coordinated
by the ISAB Data Science Committee (IDSC).  Since there is no sensitive
or proprietary content, the materials are made available publicly.
Certain workshops may be repeated from time to time.  So there is an
interest in incorporating feedback to improve these materials.
If you have an idea for improvement, feel free to open an issue.

## Jupyter Rendering and Firewalls

Many presentations are provided as Jupyter notebooks.
These are indicated by files with a `.ipynb` extension.
While intended to be rendered by a Jupyter notebook server where they
can be altered and re-executed dynamically,
GitHub can render them statically.  However, the JavaScript that
provides the rendering comes from https://render.githubusercontent.com/.
If your firewall configuration does not allow this address,
then when you select a `.ipynb` or `.pdf` file, the content will
fail to load.

You can remedy this by loading https://render.githubusercontent.com/
into your browser.  Since this page was not intended to be
invoked directly, it will simply present a default image.

After successfully loading this page, the `.ipynb` and `.pdf`
content should load.

## Background

ISAB (Information Systems Advisory Body) is a sub-committee of the
[CCJCC](http://ccjcc.lacounty.gov/)
(Countywide Criminal Justice Coordination Committee) of Los Angeles County.
As described on the
[official ISAB site](http://ccjcc.lacounty.gov/Subcommittees-Task-Forces/Information-Systems-Advisory-Board-ISAB),
ISAB is a multi-jurisdictional organization serving the justice communities
within the County of Los Angeles.  The ISAB Data Science Committee (IDSC) addresses
data science issues faced by the community.  This repository addresses
the issues of skills development.  It is not intended as an endorsement
of any product or technology.

## Workshops

The workshops are as interactive as possible.  Attendance in-person is
not always practical due to space, location, and time constraints.
These workshop provide materials for practitioners to reference during
the workshop as well as before/after the workshop.
