ISAB has amassed quite a catalog since the first delivery of the
Git Workshop in Spring of 2017.  The following diagram summarizes
the workshops as of 2021.

The offerings are color coded by category.
Hard dependencies are indicated by arrows with solid lines.
It means the target material directly depends on a grasp of
the source material.
Dashed line dependencies mean that related material is covered
in the source; but it is not absolutely necessary for particpation
in the destination workshop.
