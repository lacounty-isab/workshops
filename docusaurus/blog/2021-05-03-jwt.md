First, I haven't forgotten that we still have *Git, Part 3* to do.
I've been busy transitioning the
[CJIS Tables](https://docs.codes.lacounty-isab.org)
to production as well rewriting our subpoena delivery infrastructure.
Both projects have exposed a gap in training of many developers:
**JWT** (JSON Web Tokens).

<!--truncate-->

There are plenty of available tools and libraries that ease the task
of JWT programming.  The workshop will demonstrate a few of them so
that you can employ libraries for your own platform to create and
consume JWTs.

This will come in handy for those who need to write API clients to
invoke *update* operations in the CJIS Tables API.
Read operations will **not** require authentication.
