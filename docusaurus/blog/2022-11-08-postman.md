My original intention to offer the updated Postman workshop didn't
work out due to some unexpected event.  Now I'm looking at next
quarter for the delivery.

One new topic I plan to cover is how to work with XML payloads and
responses.  This should be especially helpful for those working with
Odyssey related APIs.
