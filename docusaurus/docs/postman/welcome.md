:::caution

This workshop is under construction and still incomplete.
This early preview is intended for feedback purposes.

:::

This workshop provides guidance on using the
[Postman](https://www.postman.com/) API testing tool in a
*teams* context within API projects coordinated by
[ISAB](http://ccjcc.lacounty.gov/Subcommittees-Task-Forces/Information-Systems-Advisory-Board-ISAB).
It doesn't use team features directly, since that would require
all participants be members of a Postman team, which is not likely
to be the case initially.  Rather, it only assumes the user is working
with the personal workspaces.  Since many team workspaces originate
as personal workspaces that are later shared, the organization and
configuration concepts described in this workshop naturally carry
over into the team setting.
