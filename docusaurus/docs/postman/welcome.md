:::caution

This workshop is under construction and still incomplete.
This early preview is intended for feedback purposes.

:::

This workshop provides guidance on using the
[Postman](https://www.postman.com/) API testing tool in a
*teams* context within API projects coordinated by
[ISAB](http://ccjcc.lacounty.gov/Subcommittees-Task-Forces/Information-Systems-Advisory-Board-ISAB).
It does not incorporate team features directly, since that would require
all participants be members of a Postman team, which is not likely
to be the case initially.  Rather, it only assumes the user is working
with personal workspaces.  Since many team workspaces originate
as personal workspaces that are later shared, the organization and
configuration concepts described in this workshop naturally carry
forward to a team setting.

## Agenda

* Postman Overview
* Native application vs Web application
* Workspaces
* Collections (of requests)
* Environments
* Variables
* Scripts

## Assumptions

This workshop assumes you are involved in API development
in some capacity, hence the motivation for your participation.
The intended audience roles are

* API provider developers
* API consumer developers
* Analysts

Before starting this workshop, you should already

* have a (free) [Postman](https://www.postman.com) account
* have installed the Postman native application for your OS.


## Credentials

The workshop exercises use two API keys and a sample
API user account.
These can't be made public without compromising
a publicly exposed API.  These credentials are generally
disabled except during the delivery of a workshop.  Their
values may be retrieved from the MS Teams channel for this
workshop.
