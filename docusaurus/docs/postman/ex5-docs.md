On the right side of a request definition, there are buttons
for adding documentation and comments to a request.

![Doc and Comment Buttons](/postman/docsAndComments1.png)

We'll add some comments of our own to the Echo sample.

1. Select the Postman Echo request we created earlier.

2. Click the **Documentation** button.

3. Click the pencil icon to active the markdown edit box.

4. Type

   ```md
   This is just for getting **started**.
   ```

   in the box and click **Save**.

5. Click the **Comments** button.

6. Click **Add Comment** and type

   ```
   That's nice; but how about invoking an API of your own.
   ```

7. Click the **Add Comment** button at the bottom.


The value of documentation and comments will become more
apparent in a **team workspace** setting.  It keeps the
conversation about the request local to the request;
rather than dispersed across several email threads.
