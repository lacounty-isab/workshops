Most of the time the Postman UI panels provide all the information
about a request and response that we need.  But many more details
are available through the *Postman console*.  The **Console** link
is at the bottom of the UI window as shown below.

Opening the console displays a hierarchical view of requests.
Expanding a single request entry reveals details for networking
(lower level protocols), the request and the reponse.

An example of expanding the **Network** node is shown below.

In the example above, one can see information about the peer
SSL certificate.
