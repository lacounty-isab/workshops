title: JWT Workshop
sidebar_label: Welcome

This workshop introduces JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) and a few tools
for working with them.  It assumes the following.

* You understand basic concepts of public/private key cryptography.
* You are comforable with the
  [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) format.
* You have OpenSSL available from the command line of your workstation.

OpenSSL comes installed on macOS and Linux.  Windows users may download
OpenSSL from one of the locations provided by the
[OpenSSL Wiki](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Binaries).
You may already have OpenSSL if you have Git installed.
See [this StackOverflow entry](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50625283/how-to-install-openssl-in-windows-10).

We only use OpenSSL to generate certificates for one of the exercises.
It's not necessary for understanding or using JWT.
