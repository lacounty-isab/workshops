## Specifications

An indepth knowledge of the JWT specification is not needed to use JWTs
productively.  For the most part, you just need to understand your JWT
library and requirements of the application you wish to invoke.  However,
if you are designing the token format of your own application,
the following links are definitive specifications references.

* __JWT__ - https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519 – explains the roles of the
  standard claims.

* __JWS__ - https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515 – explains the signature process
  and provides several detailed examples of calculating signatures.

* __JWE__ – https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7516 – this is much more involved than
  the other two.  It is not often employed – encryption is usually left to the
  transport layer.

## Libraries

A large catalog of JWT libraries is available at 

https//jwt.io/#libraries-io

* Over 100 libraries are listed.

* They cover over 30 different programming languages.
