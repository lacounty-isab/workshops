There are a number of
[Git GUI programs](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis)
available.  Some of
them are standalone; others are part of IDEs (Integrated
Development Environments) like Eclipse (Java), Visual Studio
(.Net), RStudio (R), and others.
The GUIs are mostly good.  But you are strongly encouraged
to understand the Git command line.  There are seveal benefits
to learning the Git command line.

1. Most actions of any GUI tool can be understood in terms
   of the command line.  
2. The definitive Git documentation expresses Git operation
   in terms of Git commands and command line options.
3. You may have to change between various GUI tools; but
   the command line stays the same.
4. When searching for help in public forums (such as
   <https://stackoverflow.com>), questions and answers are
   most easily expressed in terms of the command line.
5. Git commands are easily scripted.

Once you are well grounded in the command line, most GUI Git
tools are easy to learn.
