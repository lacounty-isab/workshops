Welcome to Part 2 of the Git Workshop.
There are two main topics we'll cover and a few smaller ones.

1. [Merge Conflicts](conflict/prep) - This will tie the loose end
   from Part 1, handling merges with conflicts that require manual
   intervention.

2. Remote Repositories - This will explain how to synchronize between
   local and remote repositories.  It relies on a sound understanding
   of local repositories.

Other topics we wish to explore are

* Tags
* Git hosting services
* Signing Commits

But first, let's prepare a new repository to walk through a
merge conflict scenario.
