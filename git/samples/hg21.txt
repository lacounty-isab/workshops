Chapter 21

Down on the dry, red world of Kakrafoon, in the middle
of the vast Rudlit Desert, the stage technicians were
testing the sound system.

That is to say, the sound system was in the desert, not
the technicians. They had retreated to the safety of
Disaster Area's giant control ship which hung in orbit
some four hundred miles above the planet, and they were
testing the sound from there. Anyone within five miles
of the speaker silos wouldn't have survived the tuning up.
